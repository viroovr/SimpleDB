All,

SimpleDB directory was missing TestBufMgr.java in buffer directory and Test3.java in query directory.

I just added the two files, so please copy them to your working directory and test your buffer manager and the two operators for testing.

 All,

It seems there is a possibility of getting incorrect outputs from Test3 test case.  

As in messages @51, @66, and @67 from Piazza, the output may have duplicate numbers. 

Although I haven't spent much time looking into this problem, the problem appears to be in the provided code.

Unfortunately, I don't think I can pinpoint the cause of this problem at the moment.

I will try, but to be honest with you, I am not in a condition to dedicate a lot of time to this right now. 

Since debugging this problem is beyond my expectation for this project, please just submit your code even if the output is missing some numbers and has some redundancy as follows. 

13 33 33 33 33 33 13 33 33 33 13 33 33 33 273 13

I will read your source code and give full credit if the code appears to be correct
